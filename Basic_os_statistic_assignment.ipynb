        "Interval Scale: This scale has ordered data with equal intervals between values. However, it doesn't have a \"true zero.\"\n",
        "Example: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. 0Â°C doesn't mean there is no temperature.\n",
        "Ratio Scale: This is the most detailed scale. It is ordered, has equal intervals, and features a true zero, which indicates the absence of the measured attribute.\n",
